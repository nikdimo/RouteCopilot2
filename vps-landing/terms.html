  <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
  <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of WisePlan ("the app"). By downloading, installing, or using the app, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

  <h2>3. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>WisePlan is a scheduling and route-planning application that integrates with Microsoft Outlook. It allows you to view your calendar on a map, find optimal meeting times, track completed visits, and manage your schedule. The app requires a Microsoft account and Outlook calendar access. Availability and features may vary by platform (iOS, Android, web).</p>

  <h2>4. Your Account and Responsibilities</h2>

You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works without prior written consent.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app uses third-party services including Microsoft (Outlook, Graph API) and map providers (Apple Maps, Google Maps, OpenStreetMap). Your use of those services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party service availability, accuracy, or changes.</p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR ACCURATE.

  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, MISSED MEETINGS, TRAVEL DELAYS, OR DATA LOSS, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APP IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM (OR, IF THE APP IS FREE, ZERO).</p>

  <h2>9. Termination</h2>
  <p>You may stop using the app at any time by uninstalling it and revoking access in your Microsoft account. We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the app ceases immediately.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will post updated Terms at this URL and update the "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the app. For material changes, we may notify you through the app where required.</p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of Denmark, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Denmark.</p>

  <h2>12. General</h2>
  <p>If any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in effect. Our failure to enforce any right does not waive that right. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the app.</p>
