  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>WisePlan ("we", "our", "the app") is a scheduling and route-planning application for field representatives. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data. By using WisePlan, you agree to this policy.</p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Account and authentication:</strong> When you sign in with Microsoft, we receive your email address and a unique identifier to authenticate you. We do not store your Microsoft password.</p>
  <p><strong>Calendar and contacts:</strong> With your permission, we access your Outlook calendar and contacts via Microsoft Graph API to display your schedule, suggest meeting times, and create or edit events. This data is processed in real time; we do not store copies of your calendar or contact data on our servers.</p>
  <p><strong>Location:</strong> We use your device location to show your position on the map, calculate travel times, and optimize route suggestions. Location data is processed locally on your device and by map providers; we do not track or retain your location history.</p>
  <p><strong>Usage and preferences:</strong> Your completed visits ("mark as done"), work hours, buffer times, and lunch preferences are stored locally on your device. We may receive anonymized crash reports or error logs to improve app stability.</p>
  <p><strong>Data we do not collect:</strong> We do not collect health, financial, or sensitive categories of data. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use your data solely to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide the app's core features (calendar display, scheduling, map, route optimization)</li>
    <li>Authenticate you and keep your session secure</li>
    <li>Create or update calendar events and contacts in Outlook when you request it</li>
    <li>Diagnose and fix technical issues</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use your data for advertising or to build user profiles for marketing.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We share data only with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microsoft</strong> – for authentication (OAuth) and calendar/contacts access. Microsoft's privacy policy applies: <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy.microsoft.com</a></li>
    <li><strong>Map providers</strong> – Apple Maps, Google Maps, or OpenStreetMap may receive location or search queries to display maps and directions. Their respective privacy policies apply.</li>
    <li><strong>App stores</strong> – If you download the app from the App Store or Google Play, your interaction is subject to Apple's or Google's policies. We do not receive personal data from them beyond what you provide in the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We do not retain your calendar or contact data on our servers. Data stored locally on your device (completed visits, preferences) remains until you delete the app or clear its data. Authentication tokens are retained until you sign out or revoke access. Anonymized crash data may be retained for up to 90 days.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard measures to protect your data: HTTPS for all network communication, secure storage for authentication tokens on your device, and no storage of sensitive data on our servers. You are responsible for keeping your device and Microsoft account credentials secure.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access</strong> – Request information about what data we hold (we primarily process data locally; little is stored server-side)</li>
    <li><strong>Revoke access</strong> – Revoke calendar or contacts permission in your device settings or Microsoft account at any time</li>
    <li><strong>Delete data</strong> – Uninstall the app to remove locally stored data. For server-side data, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@wiseplan.dk">support@wiseplan.dk</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), you may also have the right to rectification, restriction, portability, and to lodge a complaint with your data protection authority.</p>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>
  <p>WisePlan is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected data from a child, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy at this URL and update the "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance. For material changes, we will notify you through the app or by email where required by law.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions, data requests, or concerns about this Privacy Policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@wiseplan.dk">support@wiseplan.dk</a>.</p>
